Data taken from- https://data.gov.in/resources/state-and-ut-wise-total-recorded-forest-area-and-forest-cover-india-state-forest-report
Bar plot- It is noticed that many states from the NorthEast have high forest densities (calculated as Forest Area/ Total Area).
Scatter plot- The line separates states/ UTs with more than 33% forest area (above the line) and less than 33%. It is noticed that states/ UT with more area have lower forest density
Box plot- The distribution of forest cover and forest area looks very similar but the numbers are much smaller than geograhical areas.

The plots have been made using matplotlib using Jupyter Notebook in Python.
